                    <blockquote>Have you ever thought about the way your car makes you feel? Does it make you feel anything at all? Or is it just a 
                        piece of sheet metal? Simply a way to get you from A to B? We believe a car should stir the emotions. It should make your heart 
                        race before you even get behind the wheel. This is our mantra: Make cars that make driving matter. That's why we build every 
                        Mazda to inspire, excite and most of all - bring people joy. This philosophy guides everything we do. From technology, 
                        to design, to safety. Our cars are built by insightful craftsmen and detail-obsessed engineers who want to elevate your state 
                        of being every time you get behind the wheel.</blockquote>
